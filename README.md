## Project Structure

- **MVC Architecture**: Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture was used in the project. In this way, the organization of the code is ensured and easy maintenance and development opportunities are provided.

- **Express.js Framework**: Express.js was used for the web application. This lightweight and flexible framework enables rapid development.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that works with documents in the JSON-like BSON format.

- **Passport.js**: Passport.js is used for user authentication. User login was provided and session management was carried out with local strategy.

- **Express Sessions and Connect-MongoDB-Session**: User session information is stored in MongoDB. This provides more secure session management.

- **Express Validator**: Express Validator was used for form validation. In this way, control and processing of incoming data is ensured.

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: EJS is used to use HTML templates. This makes it easier to create dynamic pages.

- **Nodemailer**: Nodemailer was used to send the password reset link.

- **Multer**: Multer is used for file uploading operations.

- **dotenv**: dotenv is used to manage environmental variables.

## How to Run

1. Clone the project to your computer.
2. Create your MongoDB database with your connection information.
3. Create the `.env` file and define the necessary environmental variables (for example: `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `PORT`).
4. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in terminal or command prompt.
5. Start the application using the `npm start` command in terminal or command prompt.
